# User Management System

## PHP Setup Instructions

To set up the PHP environment for the User Management System, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PHP installed on your local machine. You can download it from [PHP's official website](https://www.php.net/downloads).

2. Install Composer, a dependency manager for PHP, by following the instructions on [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syntax-Seeker/User_Management-System.git
   cd User_Management-System
   ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

5. Set up your database and configure the database connection in the `.env` file.

6. Run the PHP built-in server to start the application:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the User Management System.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have the required PHP extensions enabled to ensure the application runs smoothly.
